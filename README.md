<sub>Future Enhancements: Potential features include:
• Adding course difficulty weighting and tools to simulate different grade scenarios to optimize for a higher CWA.
• Exporting results and course breakdowns as a PDF or CSV for record-keeping or sharing with advisors.
• Integrating a simple “what-if planner” where you can set target CWAs and get suggested grade distributions to reach them.
• Saving and loading past semesters so you can track your progress over time.
• Supporting multiple grading schemes (e.g., GPA scales) for international users.</sub>
